1.Create a new repository

`Repository name`: 

Make sure to use ur username as the repo name. It should be ==Yourusername.github.io==



2.本地clone，放文件，push

The mainpage is named as index.html and also check if the ==index.html== file is in the root directory and not in any sub folder. 

- if u have only one project in ur repo then make sure that the index file is in [https://wliu0025.github.io](https://wliu0025.github.io) 
-  If u have multiple projects in ur repo then access it by adding the subfolder name in the URL along with the repo name, like this https://wliu0025.github.io/fit5147dvp/
